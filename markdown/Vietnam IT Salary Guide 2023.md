# OPEN LETTER

Vietnam’s economic recovery accelerated post-Covid-19 partly on the back of innovation performance. The country was placed 48 out of 132 economies in the 2022 Global Innovation Index which measures nations’ innovative capacities and outputs. Besides, Vietnam’s decent output performance (ranking 41 out of 132 countries) indicates that it is observing high returns from innovation investments.

But on the other hand, challenges remain. For example, the continued disruption of global supply chains has negatively impacted the economic well-being of countries, including Vietnam. Innovation and productivity should be the main drivers of sustainable growth. Vietnam needs a successful shift to an innovation-driven economy from the labor-intensive and natural resource-dependent growth model.

This transition is possible, seeing that the country boasts improved qualifications of the workforce, particularly tech workers. According to Coursera’s Global Skills Report 2022, Vietnam is performing well in terms of technology skills proficiency. The level is rated "competitive" above “emerging” and “lagging”, and only behind "cutting-edge."

With that market status in mind, JT1 conducted a research study to better understand how the views and behaviors of employers and employees in the information technology industry and their interactions have been altered accordingly. Ultimately, it shall guide tech professionals and enterprises from insight to action.

Realized FDI investment (foreign direct investment), particularly in Vietnam’s IT and communication sector, in the nine months of 2022 was up 16.3% YOY. This reflects foreign investors’ confidence in the country’s business investment environment.

#### Barriers to DX in the country:
- Complex technology and software
- Lack of planning and strategy
- Lack of qualified, high-performing IT team

### 2. TECH STARTUPS
**Only the strong survive**

Home to over 3,800 startups, Vietnam is the region’s **5th best** country for this ecosystem and the **54th worldwide**.

**Most funded startup sectors 2021:**

- 2016: 205
- 2017: 291
- 2018: 889
- 2019: 861
- 2020: 317

2021 witnessed huge investments into the startup ecosystem, which was around four times 2020’s figure.

In the first half of 2022, the venture capitals are still active when maintaining positive momentum from the end of 2021. Nevertheless, a slowdown in the market is the projection for the last six months. U.S tech stocks are falling, with the six largest tech companies losing over $500 billion in value on September 13.

## THE IT LABOR MARKET

### 1. WORKFORCE WITH HIGH PROFICIENCY IN TECHNOLOGY & AT COMPETITIVE COSTS

Vietnam’s software development outsourcing cost is around **90% lower** than hiring the U.S. labor force. The saving is **50% versus China** and **30% versus India**.

#### Hourly cost comparison:
| Role | Vietnam | Malaysia | Singapore | India | China | US |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Software development | $25-$35 | $30-$50 | $55-$65 | $28-$42 | $37-$60 | $81-$101 |

#### Skills set ranking in Asia Pacific
(Source: Global Skills Report 2022, Coursera)

| Global Rank | Country Name | Business | Technology | Data Science |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 5 | Singapore | 90% | 95% | 82% |
| 14 | Hong Kong | 84% | 78% | 86% |
| 35 | Vietnam | 42% | 65% | 72% |
| 39 | Malaysia | 69% | 49% | 57% |
| 43 | Myanmar | 87% | 23% | 43% |
| 49 | Thailand | 49% | 48% | 62% |
| 52 | China | 72% | 25% | 58% |
| 53 | Taiwan | 32% | 47% | 66% |
| 70 | Philippines | 62% | 29% | 21% |

*Note: Coursera categories: Lagging (0-25%), Emerging (25%-50%), Competitive (50%-75%), Cutting-edge (75%-100%).*

Good technical skills and quick learning ability aside, reasonable labor costs are the country’s competitive advantage.

### 2. TECH STAFF IN HIGH DEMAND

The current market situation is favorable for tech workers - from China's manufacturing exodus and Vietnam’s free trade agreements with the EU, South Korea, and Japan to US-China trade tensions and operational disruption in China. For resilience, multinational companies have expanded their business to emerging markets like Vietnam known for its demographic, geographic, economic, and regulatory advantages.

---

While the demand is increasing, the supply of available qualified candidates does not suffice. On the one hand, the talent pool is growing fast as a result of the local government and enterprises’ ongoing efforts in improving the workforce's skill sets. But on the other hand, there are fewer qualified candidates per hire, considering:
- Higher-quality foreign direct investment flows
- The accelerated economic transition from labor-intensive industries to high-tech ones
- Heightened expectations for tech workers (technical skills + behavioral competencies like teamwork and foreign language).

### 3. ABOVE-AVERAGE SALARY PACKAGES

Again, 2022 observes the growing interest of big tech companies such as Google and Amazon in investment in Vietnam. They show a serious intent in achieving long-run business growth here with higher compensation offerings than the market average to attract and retain top talent.

### PAY DIFFERENCE OF LOCAL VS. MNC
(Annual Base Salary COMP1)
- Para-professional: **-18%**
- Professional: **-18%**
- Management: **-18%**
- Overall: **-31%**

### 4. CHANGES IN EMPLOYEE MINDSETS

The uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and recent inflation have made employees consider their career path, salary, work culture, and additional well-being support more cautiously. Post-Covid, sectors with flexible culture and sustainability are more desirable. The hybrid working model provides employees with opportunities to work productively in the comfort of their own homes.

#### HYBRID WORK IS NOW PREFERRED ACROSS ALL MARKETS
(Source: Cisco Global Hybrid Work Study 2022)
- **72%** want hybrid working arrangement
- **23%** fully remote
- **5%** fully in office

**Regional Hybrid Preference:**
- Vietnam: 76%
- Philippines: 60%
- Thailand: 69%
- Malaysia: 74%
- Singapore: 71%
- Indonesia: 84%

### VACANCY RATE & AVERAGE ASKING RENT OF HCMC OFFICE Q1 2022
(Source: Cushman & Wakefield)

The chart shows steady Grade-A and Grade-B rents with vacancy rates fluctuating between 8% and 10% from 2018 to 2022. By embracing the remote working concept, enterprises can reduce overhead costs, including rent.

### EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE SURVEY RESULTS
**Employees with CHOICE vs. NO CHOICE**

| Category | No Choice (% Agreement) | Freedom to Choice (% Agreement) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Ability to focus | ~58% | ~88% |
| Collaboration | ~55% | ~84% |
| Ability to do best work | ~59% | ~81% |
| Continuing to learn | ~51% | ~78% |
| Bond with colleagues | ~52% | ~76% |
| Feeling energized | ~26% | ~58% |

Giving staff the power of choice (e.g., remote/hybrid working) can help improve their performance.

## 2023 PREDICTIONS

### 1. DX CONTINUES TO BE HIGH ON THE PRIORITY LIST FOR FIRMS

We expect 2023 to be a year that enterprises of all sizes and across all industries will continue to focus heavily on their technology and digital capabilities. DX becomes a beacon that they look to when attempting to remain competitive.

Successful businesses will have at least one of these things in common:
- Create products or services identifying with customer needs.
- Manage to cover business cost (including employees), optimize cash flow, and expand customer base.

### 2. BUSINESS EXPANSION TO VIETNAM

We see a rising trend of the world’s corporate giants (particularly those from Europe) entering Vietnam and placing regional roles here. The global economy is heading for recession. Thus, companies strive to cut costs and increase business revenues. This will give an edge to the labor market in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam.

#### 2022 GLOBAL OUTSOURCING RATES
- North America: **$49 - $210**
- Latin America: **$28 - $105**
- Central & Eastern Europe: **$21 - $118**
- South Asia: **$21 - $82**
- Southeast Asia: **$21 - $61**

Forbes called Vietnam “a small but mighty outsourcing powerhouse in the Asia-Pacific… one with a tech spirit and talented population."

### 3. THE RISING DEMAND FOR TECH TALENT & THE NEED TO REIMAGE THE WORKFORCE

Hiring for tech positions will keep thriving on the back of enterprises’ DX. The most sought-after candidates can be professionals with rapid upskilling, a modernization mindset, and adaptability.
