## Foreword

The labour and employment market in 2022 had a turbulent year with many rapid and unpredictable movements.

In early 2022, many factories had to deal with backlogs of orders while many workers who had been to their hometowns during pandemic did not return to major cities to work, which led to a local labour shortage.

However, the scenario reversed at the end of the year when Vietnam had a surplus of workers but a shortage of orders due to the decline in purchasing power in export markets, global political uncertainty, rising living costs, and tight monetary policy, etc. Domestic businesses were forced to cut costs and cut down headcounts. This unexpected “shock” goes against the norm of increased hiring demand during the peak year-end season.

Notably, the news of layoffs in several industries has dominated headlines since the second half of 2022, especially in Technology, E-commerce, and Real Estate. December saw a slow-down of the waves, but their impact has left the market undeniably quieter.

Experts forecast that in the coming time, the production will continue facing difficulties due to a lack of orders, possibly during the end of Q1 or as late as the Q2 of 2023, resulting in many workers being unemployed and losing their jobs. However, it is optimistically believed that by the end of 2023, the situation will improve, and the labour market will soon see the positive. Accordingly, spearhead industries will continue to take advantage and maintain their strong growth momentum. Manufacturing, especially in wood production, footwear, apparel, etc., will soon make a recovery or even a breakthrough at the end of 2023. With higher purchasing power as well as higher living standard of consumers in the domestic market, Consumer Goods and Healthcare remains as well-performing sectors with stable and even booming demand.

Despite the economic uncertainty, 47% of employers still plan to keep headcounts the same in 2023 as it was in 2022, and 43% even expect an increase of their headcounts according to Adecco Vietnam’s research “HR Landscape and Labour Market Outlook 2023”. Top industries with headcount increase forecast are Manufacturing; Supply chain, Logistics & Transportation; and Healthcare, Medical & Science.

Regarding to main objectives, efficient cost control is key driver to HR decision in 2023. Majority of employers are seeking cross-over-skilled staff to handle multitasking roles (nearly a half of respondents prioritise this skill). Together with the dominance of digitalisation, there will be a high demand for highly skilled workers, particularly those with good digital knowledge and adaptability.

While the economic tension is boosting employers to seek costbalanced solutions for their businesses, employees are trying to manage their living costs to cope with the inflation. Indeed, majority of working people in our study placed salary among the top factors that impact their career choice.

In this ever-changing market while competition is severe and highly skilled candidates are scarce with complex job expectation, we understand it would be tough for businesses to make decision regarding their people. With diverse experiences in the HR industry and more than 11 years in the Vietnam market, Adecco Vietnam can offer more than just Payroll and Recruitment services. We provide one-stop solutions for all your HR needs, from Training, Candidate Assessment Tools to Salary Benchmarking, to bring you both convenience and efficiency in running your business and managing your workforce.

> "This 10th edition of Vietnam Salary Guide is another effort from Adecco Vietnam to provide you with a broad overview of the current market offerings in 2 major cities: Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City."
>
> "We hope this release will be a handy tool with strategic talent development and recruitment in 2023 for both job seekers and HR professionals. For comprehensive data on salary, compensation, and all types of employee benefits within your specific industry, peer groups, or the marketplace, please refer to our Salary Benchmarking Service."

## Human Resources

### Market overview
2022 observes a return of high hiring demands for HR functions across different industries together with the massive movements of HR professionals from mid-senior to top management level.

Recruitment of HR professionals continues to be noticeable in both Manufacturing and Technology industries with remarkable job orders for Head of HR, HR Manager, and HR Business Partner. As the supplies of experienced candidate within the relevant industries had no longer met the excessive hiring demands, employer’s preferences had shifted towards candidates from different industries yet with strong HR practice in MNCs, strategic in business transformation, building company culture, talent management and employee engagement.

We did also notice the need for HR professionals across functions within Retail industry, which marked the successful recovery of the industry, itself after all the immense challenges caused by Covid-19 pandemic.

2022 also marked the year in which we received great amount of hiring requests from smaller enterprises across industries for Office / Administration Manager, who not only handles office facilities and administration but also manages accounting / finance and HR service providers that we then observed the trend of SMEs to outsource the most parts of HR operations to outside HR service agencies.

### Advices for employers
Gen Z is joining the labour force with much promising potential and is becoming an important part of an organisation. The employers should actively drive on culture change to adapt, retain as well as structure learning and development programs that close the gap.

Employers should design tailor-made career training progress for different levels to catch up and leverage business opportunies. By doing this, they can create key non-financial benefits that are highly appreciated by the employees.

### Advices for employees
Candidate with business partner mindset will be at the top criteria for selection process. Thus, acquiring and nurturing such mindset through deeply engaging with and understanding about organisation’s goals is important to sharpen candidate’s competency.

Beside being business partner, candidate is also required to be technology savvy and possess a digital mindset that is essential for the era of HR Digital Transformation.

Unlocking potential through proactively involving in HR agility projects will help employees fuel performance in the future.

## Legal

### Market overview
Despite the severe consequences and impact caused by Covid-19, the overall demand for in-house and private practice legal professionals was still at high record in 2022.

The need for qualified mid to senior lawyers continued to rise in law firms. Meanwhile, corporations had been striving not only to retain but also to attract legal candidates at midddle / senior level. We did observe the high volume of client orders for Legal Counsel and Legal Manager vacancies, the industries of which heavily focused on Renewable Energy and E-commerce.

The second half of 2022 witnessed a massive restructuring and / or layoff wave in various industries, noticeably in Real Estate and Manufacturing leading to the lower demand in top-notched legal professionals. Nevertheless, the need for legal professionals at middle level remains unchanged. Yet, we witnessed the emergence of employing legal professionals within Industrial / Warehouse Development already started from the beginning of the year.

### Advices for employers
Employers should invest more on trainings for their Legal team in areas such as Investment, Project Management, M&A, and Analytical Skills in order to better prepare them for recent and upcoming market opportunities.

### Advices for employees
As legal professional has been transforming into being legal business partner, employer’s hiring preferences are candidates with strong stakeholders management skills, good analytical mindset, business and financial acumen.

It is essential for Lawyers / Legal counsel to improve their language skills and update LegalTech trends to keep up with many international transactions and M&A opportunities.

## Technology & Media

### Market overview
2022 has been a year of drastic changes in the technology market. The early half of 2022 witnessed a preference toward the digital and technology talents. Companies significantly focused on their tech and digital capabilities. Along with tech start-ups who were on a right track of business-scaling, the large conglomerates have also been giving a considerate attention toward digital transformation programs.

The second half 2022 was a full-of-surprise period for the technology market as tech layoffs news have been taking over all the headlines since early July. The reversal of over-hiring and companies’ cost-cutting measurement are seen as fundamental reasons. December saw a slow-down of the layoff waves, but their impact has left the technology market undeniably quieter.

As a result, 2023 can be a year of highly careful hiring decisions for tech companies. Meanwhile, traditional firms, with sound fundamentals that has yet to completely modernise, can embrace this as an opportunity for modernisation and digital transformation, outcompeting tech companies in hiring the high-quality talents who were only inclined to the hi-tech and internet giants in the past.

### Advices for employers
Despite the massive layoffs occuring recently, the jobs and workforce in Big Data, AI, ML and Digital Transformation fields remain essential and needed in Technology sector. The employers should maintain a core team in this field to be ahead of the arising technological trends.

Designing upskilling and reskilling training programs to retain top talents will help employer minimise opportunity cost.

### Advices for employees
Improving language skill and self management skills are key learnings for tech employees as it is market trend.

It is essential to continuously acquire and keep updated with the latest knowledge and technologies such as AI, ML, etc.

## Sales & Marketing: Healthcare

### Market overview
Despite the inflation and economic recession, the Healthcare industry in Vietnam is forecasted to continue to grow steadily in the coming period when the demand for medical examination and treatment, drug prices, and hospital fees increase sharply and input costs increase at a much slower rate.

In recent years, the Healthcare market in Vietnam has been growing rapidly. During and after the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, this industry has even more opportunities to develop because there are more medical needs and people are increasingly aware of their health.

Vietnam’s Healthcare industry is segmented into three subsectors: Medical equipment, Pharmaceuticals, as well as Hospitals and clinics. There has been a shift in labour force from public to private hospitals due to low wages, high health and regulatory risks, and poor public facilities.

In 2023, as the positive change in consumers behaviour opens up more opportunities for the growth of pharmaceutical and medical device sectors, the need for talent will also continue to grow within Healthcare organisations. Coming along the digitalisation, opportunities arise for talents with good digital adaptability to embrace new positions.

### Advices for employers
Companies should provide intensive training on mandatory comprehensive skillsets related to sales, tender, and marketing so that the employees can adapt with company’s personnel restructure (simplify the organisational structure).

### Advices for employees
Employees in this field should enhance the multitasking ability, team management, area management and supply chain management competency as well as continuously improve language proficiency and soft skills.
