## General Manager's Message

**2023: A challenging yet promising year for doing business in Vietnam**

Dear readers,

I am pleased to introduce our ManpowerGroup Vietnam Salary Guide 2023.

After 8 years of living and working in Vietnam, I am happy to say that Vietnam is a great country for foreign investment thanks to its abundant hardworking, highly adaptable and eager-to-learn workforce. The country was ranked 7th in the list of 2022 Best Countries to Start a Business¹. Notably, the salary trends in Vietnam have witnessed significant evolution in recent years. Vietnamese white-collar workforce's salary has risen in the last few years, partly due to inflation, but also because the workers' skills have significantly improved over the years.

Remarkably, the bright recruitment landscape in Vietnam is reported in our latest Vietnam Employment Outlook Survey for the second half of 2022. Accordingly, up to 90% of the surveyed enterprises plan to increase or maintain their current headcounts. Strongest recruitment plans in the second half were reported in Manufacturing & Processing, Wholesale, Retail & Trading, Banking & Finance, Construction, Real Estate, etc. An increasingly fierce competition for talent with relevant skills that enable organizations to thrive is raging on.

Vietnam Salary Guide 2023 provides a comprehensive overview of salary for hundreds of roles, especially the latest labor trends in 12 key industries. It is packed with helpful information for hiring managers and candidates alike. The Guide serves as a reference for any businesses in Vietnam who want to develop an effective talent strategy to win in this changing world of work.

Let's conquer the uncertainty and win in Year of the Rabbit 2023!

Thank you.

**Andree Mangels**
General Manager, ManpowerGroup Vietnam

## Labor market overview

Following the increasing FDI flow into Vietnam after the pandemic, the need for outstanding HR leaders is on the rise. In most industries, there has been a high demand for functional HR expertise such as HR Business Partner, Employer Branding, Internal Communication & Employee Engagement and Talent Development. The need for a highly skilled workforce is most visible in technology, manufacturing, and consumer sectors which are the key engines for economic recovery. International manufacturers have been shifting their supply chains to Vietnam thanks to the country's diverse favorable conditions for business. As a result, job opportunities in HR, administration and other back-office roles are growing.

The global health crisis has made people rethink about the definition of work and their top priorities when considering a job offer. Health and wellbeing, safety, skill development programs, recognition and rewards, especially flexible work (hybrid work) are now as important as salary. Therefore, employers who understand those needs and transform them into suitable recruitment and retention strategies would be able to attract the best talent. The increasing importance of the workforce management in the new normal also means HR experts with desired expertise in training & development and diversity & inclusion are most sought-after.

## Labor market overview

With the strong growth in manufacturing, investment fund, real estate and fintech sectors, 2023 is forecasted to be a year for finance and accounting professionals. Frequently hired roles include Chief Finance Officer, Financial Planning & Analysis Manager, Investment Manager and Finance Business Partner. There is also a higher demand for senior finance professionals who master strategic leadership skills to cope with the challenges of the post pandemic economic situation. With that being said, the top tier Financial Planning & Analysis, Finance Business Partner and Tax Manager will be in high demand in 2023. Meanwhile, the rising economic uncertainties and digital acceleration have made companies realize the importance of matters like risk management and data privacy, which increases the need for Legal and Compliance professionals.

While companies strive to increase their investment in headcount and expertise, hybrid or flexible work is among highly desired benefits by workers of all levels in 2023. Therefore, organizations will likely have to spend more effort to attract talent by offering them flexible benefits, shortened interview processes and competitive packages.

Candidates with professional certificates like ACCA, CPA, CFA etc. are preferred by employers, in terms of professional knowledge requirements.

## Procurement, Logistics & Supply Chain

## Labor market overview

Supply chain and logistics are expected to remain the "bright spot" in the 2023 economic outlook. Enterprises are constantly expanding their service scope. In addition to the vibrant freight forwarding sector as a result of the fruitful development of e-commerce, many companies have increased their investment in warehousing and domestic delivery services. It is estimated that Vietnam's logistics market grows by over 5.5% per year during the 2022-2030 period.

The hiring trend continues with the significantly growing need for top tier professionals in sourcing, merchandising and procurement. Notably, international businesses are pouring investment into Vietnam, believing that the country is the next production and supply hub in Asia for DIY, electronics, tool and accessories product lines.

The development of supply chain and logistics has made sales and business development positions the most in-demand in 2022, a trend forecasted to continue next year. As regards to professional skills, data analysis and continuous improvement skills are seen as must-haves for workers in the industry. Candidates are also expected to own key soft skills like adaptability or problem-solving skills.

The above factors have contributed to making recruitment in this industry fiercer and more challenging than ever. In order to attract talent and retain long-term employees, employers need to pay more attention to the retention factors such as C&B, career development, working environment, training and so on. For strategic positions, it is important to implement an internal build strategy instead of focusing on the buy strategy only.

## Labor market overview

The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated global digital transformation in many countries, including Vietnam. With great potential and strong economic growth, Vietnam's digital economy is expected to become one of the largest in South East Asia. Besides, given the support of the Vietnamese government, the high adoption rate of new technologies and the growing youth population, Vietnam has established itself as an ideal business destination attracting attention from businesses and investors all over the world. Therefore, the need for highly-skilled digital talent remains strong and competitive in 2023.

More and more organizations of all sizes and industries are looking for digital talent across all functions to drive business forward. However, the gap of digital skills in the local labor market remains high. To address the immediate skills gap and to remain competitive in the marketplace, beside holistic talent acquisition strategies, companies need to reskill and upskill their current workforce to meet their changing business and industry demands. Internal and external training at a company level plays a critical role in the workforce transformation journey. Given the skill mismatch in different labor markets, companies should look beyond boundaries in recruitment, in other words, to hire overseas Vietnamese or expatriates. This helps resolve the immediate talent shortage.

Most desired positions at senior and C-Suite positions are in Software, Outsourcing, Digital Platforms, Blockchain, SaaS, AI, Fintech, E-commerce, etc.

## Labor market overview

Vietnam banking and financial services sector continues to embrace digital transformation as its long-term strategy in 2023. Most of the local banks and financial institutions have actively joined this journey and transformed their business operations with the aim to enhance customer experience, customer base, and efficiency in their full cycle of operation. Highest number of open vacancies include roles in IT, Data Analytics, Digital Marketing and R&D. Expatriate talent in these key positions is highly desired, too.

The pandemic seems to no longer have a significant impact on businesses in this sector. However, it still drives attention at top management level and results in newly created roles such as Head of Internal Communication, Culture & Well-being Manager, Internal Organization Psychologist, etc.

Thanks to the favorable economic conditions, foreign investment funds and securities firms are expanding their operations in Vietnam with high recruitment demand in Legal, HR, IT, and Finance roles at various levels.

2023 is expected to see more newborn digital-only models in financial services sector, which leads to the emerging demand for C-levels and positions in product, partnership, and digital marketing.

## Labor market overview

As one of the key drivers of the national economic recovery, the consumer goods industry in Vietnam, especially through e-commerce and modern trade channels, has grown substantially throughout 2022. The number of retailers, including well-known international brands newly entering Vietnam, has been increasing gradually in key cities and reaching further into provinces nationwide. With big international retail brand names like Uniqlo entering the market, the retail industry has recovered significantly post the pandemic. Therefore, the rising demand in recruitment has been significant in the retail and consumer market in the areas of retail development, revenue growth management and commerce.

As digital society and media have blurred the borders in consumers' purchasing habits, urban and rural consumer groups are getting even closer. We can foresee continued demand for top-tier talent in sales roles, marketing director, digital and e-commerce head as well as senior modern trade professionals.

In 2023, many retailers have put forward their ambitious growth plans with new openings of supermarkets, distribution systems and new retail models. With Vietnamese national financial health on its way to recovery, the consumer goods and retail industries are expected to continue their growth momentum next year. So does the demand for store operations, category and merchandising talent.

## Labor market overview

As for the public healthcare sector, the rise of middle income families has led to an increased demand for greater healthcare services. This has boosted the demand for top skilled clinical operations professionals as well as doctors.

Another impact is the pandemic under which pharmaceutical and medical device companies across Vietnam continue to have strong recruitment demand. There is a need for experienced technical healthcare professionals to strengthen brand development in the competitive market. Frequent demand for Business Unit Heads, Medical Affairs and Market Access Managers are also seen in both pharmaceutical and medical device enterprises. Among regular positions in the healthcare industry, a number of new management roles have arisen such as Chief Transformation Officer, Business Transformation Manager, Digital Transformation Manager and Business Development Manager.

In 2023, as the need for talent continues within healthcare organizations coming along the digitization, opportunities arise for talents with good digital adaptability to embrace new positions. This will enable developing new areas of expertise that the market has never had. Therefore, it can be foreseen that the hiring need for professionals in the healthcare industry with digitally adopted skills would significantly increase.

## Labor market overview

Post the pandemic, the manufacturing sector continued to play its key role in the development of Vietnam's economy in 2022. More and more investors have considered Vietnam, which is one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, as a top choice destination for their expansion plan. In addition, as global manufacturers are shifting away from China, Vietnam has risen as a viable option for contract manufacturing with a number of newly setup factories nationwide in 2022 and is expecting more in 2023.

Meanwhile, the adoption of automation, robotics and advanced technology into production has impacted the structure and distribution of labor in manufacturing. The demand for skilled labor is rising and talent shortage becomes a huge challenge across most manufacturing companies. The issue is particularly visible when it comes to highly skilled positions such as quality management, product technical management, operation project management & automation, and technology engineering. The most outstanding reason for hiring difficulty in the industry comes from skill shortages, as reported in a ManpowerGroup Vietnam's survey with the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs. FDI employers say that some soft skills like discipline compliance, time management, teamwork, adaptability, initiative-taking, and foreign language as well as professional/technical skills are in serious shortage.

To deal with difficulties in recruitment, employers need to focus on internal training programs and employee retention strategy as a priority. They should also consider borrowing strategy - to cultivate communities of talent beyond their organizations via staffing service companies, thus being able to approach a wider range of talent pool.

## Labor market overview

In recent years, more and more global businesses have aimed for a common goal in reducing emissions - Net Zero, which also means more growth space is available for renewable energy.

2022 witnessed the emerging trend of global businesses proactively exploring clean energy solutions to step up ESG efforts. Yet, it is expected that during 2023 there will be more new project development within the renewable sector in an attempt of Vietnamese government to promote sustainable economic development.

One most explicit evidence is the Lego project, where Danish toymaker announced a 1-billion-USD greenfield investment in Vietnam. This is its sixth factory worldwide yet the first carbon neutral one to be powered entirely by solar energy with Manpower Vietnam immensely delighted to be appointed as the pioneer hiring partner for the project. This is a milestone as to Vietnam's continuously improving competitiveness as an investment destination for global corporations in terms of the ability to provide clean energy.

With the purpose of supporting the maturity of the renewable sector in particular and the energy industry in general, the utmost priority now and in upcoming years is to build the capabilities and upskill in project development, construction and operations. It is also advised to incorporate green energy innovations into the employer brands to attract new talent into the industry.

## Labor market overview

Foreign trade and export of electronics and components, machinery appliances, textiles/garments, footwear, etc. accounted for 63.9% of the country's total exports in 2022, and are forecasted to have significant growth in the coming years.

The labor demand in these sectors has increased significantly this year and will most likely continue to keep its momentum in 2023. Vietnam has benefited greatly from China's manufacturing exodus and FTAs with the EU, Japan, and South Korea. Recently, the US - China trade tension and Russia - Ukraine war have made firms diversify their supply chains. Against this background, Vietnam is considered a potential destination for foreign direct investment in the industries.

As demand for highly skilled professionals continues in production management, quality assurance and engineering functions, it has also deepened existing skills shortages in this sector. Besides, the search for talent in sourcing, trading, and sales is very competitive as there is an abundance of job opportunities in the market.

Apart from technical skills, the most sought-after soft skills include accountability, reliability and discipline, resilience, stress tolerance and adaptability, initiative-taking, reasoning and problem-solving.

In terms of C-suite positions, leadership and social influence are the most important differentiators of successful senior level candidates.

## Labor market overview

Vietnam is a “rare bright spot” in attracting the world's real estate capital inflows with more and more open FDI policies. In the first half of 2022, real estate was the second largest FDI attraction, with a total investment of USD 3.15 billion, accounting for 22.5% of total registered investment capital.

With a population of nearly 100 million people, Vietnam is facing a housing shortage, creating strong growth opportunities for this market. Particularly, in order to narrow the gap between supply and demand and make the dream of home ownership more feasible for the majority of people, social housing construction projects are booming, with many preferential policies from the government. By end of 2022, there were 300 projects of social housing completed, and 400 other projects being on the way.

Global social and economic uncertainties made corporations diversify their production locations. Thanks to its stable political and social situation and favorable geographical position, Vietnam emerged as a bright star and benefited from this wave of displacement. This has resulted in the increasing demand for industrial real estate. New factories being under construction are expected to create thousands of jobs for local workers.

Other outstanding trends in construction and real estate such as strong investment waves in satellite urban areas, and the rising preference for smart homes, smart cities promise to generate great job opportunities in these areas.

## Labor market overview

Given that Vietnam's GDP in the second quarter of 2022 increased by 7.72% over the same period last year, it is foreseen that the consulting and services sectors will revive in 2023. This was reflected in the strong need to recruit professionals across education, business process outsourcing, management consulting and hospitality industries.

Despite consulting firms did suffer during Covid-19 as they reported slow revenue growth, all largest firms reported revenue growth above the pre-pandemic level in 2022. Most critical hires are from digital and implementation, people and organizations, as well as transformation. In 2023, continuing with the strong comeback for the hospitality and F&B industry, the demand would be seen rapidly for Sales & Marketing, Customer Experience, and Revenue Manager, etc. However, even top organizations are tackling the talent shortage as the service industry which requires full attendance would no longer be a great choice of work application. Exploring all the possibilities of flexible working will be a smart choice for organizations in this sector.

As for the business services sector, 2022 was a year of transforming traditional business services to the new inclusion of digital services with hybrid work model, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence and automated services delivered via the cloud. Thus, 2023 will continue the trend of technology integrators to advance to all-round service provider with a wide portfolio of service offerings across the industries. Roles with strong demand will still be Call Center Manager, Operation Manager and Project Manager.
